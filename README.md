## Introduction
In this project we used machine learning to determine if Van Gogh paintings were done by the artist or were done by a child. 

## System Requirements
* AWS S3 -- used for storage of images
* Google Colab -- used to run Tensor Flow model
* HTML -- Website 
* Bootstrap -- website elements
* Jupyter Lab -- Data Storage

## Data Sources
* [Van Gogh Website](https://www.vincentvangogh.org/)
* Guthrie Memorial Library Facebook Page Hanover, PA

## Project Description
This project used paintings by Vincent van Gogh to determine if the the image was done by the artist himself, or done by a child. Multiple machine learning models were used to test loss and accuracy. 
* Non-Convolutional Model -
